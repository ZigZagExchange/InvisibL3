-- for every token sum the fees from all transactions and update it only once at the end
-- add possibility to share the fees among different specified users
-- for every transaction:
    > verify the fee ratio (in case of partial fills) is le what user signed for
    > the fee is part of the order can't be paid seperately for simplicity

-- For now only dealing with L2 vaults could later add L1 vaults (vaults = account spaces in my design)

-- verify limit orders were signed by the sender and update the corresponding account dicts

-- after all transactions and account dict updates, verify the merkle updates of the initial dict hashes

-- figure out how order ids prevent replay attacks (order id = order hash)


SWAP (settlement):

-- check that amounts sold and baught are in range (0, UPPER BOUND)
-- verify that token_spent_A == token_received_B and vice-versa
